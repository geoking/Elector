# Elector
'Elector' is an app on your iOS smartphone or Mac computer that will randomly elect an item from your to-do list each day. 

This will effectively be a to-do application with a couple of small twists - it will prioritise one item a day and will only let you complete one item a day, so bigger tasks are advised. It will also have content from the internet available which can give users ideas on what to do or what to add to their own to-do list. 

The idea is that a user will access the app twice a day - once to check what their to-do item is, and later on to tick that off once it has been done. 

As a future goal, user suggestions could come to the app where users can suggest what to add to the global to-do list, that other users could add to their own to-do lists.
